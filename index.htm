            <p>
                World Day for Safety and Health at Work is a day which is celebrated every year since 2003.
                This day has been observed in the form of a campaign, a specific theme is given each year.
                This year, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it has become the topic of observation.

            <p>
                As this day is specifically for the lookout for the problems in workspaces,
                COVID-19 has forced quarantine in several countries such as India, China, Denamark,
                and the list goes on.
                <br>
                In order to pay homage to the theme, we have a list of things you can do during the Quarantine.

            <a name="esafety"></a>
            <p>Just because the theme of the day is on the COVID-19 Panademic, it doesn't mean that we shouldn't be safe
                in
                other ways.
                eSafety is important as well, with all the time we are spending on our devices. Here is a list of
                problems
                we could face, as well as some preventions.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>RSI - Repetitive Strain Injury</li>
                <p>
                    RSI or Repetitive Strain Injury is an injury which may cause pain
                    in the forearms, elbows, wrists, hands, necks and shoulders.
                    It is caused by the overuse of the muscles and tendons of the upper body.
                    The only prevention of this from occuring is to stop the overuse of
                    texting, typing and other continuous activities which may cause pain.
                </p>
                <li>Eye Strain</li>
                <p>
                    Eye Strain, or Asthenopia is the condition whihc occurs in the eye upon the intense use of it.
                    It may cause fatigue, pain in and around the eyes, headaches, blurred vision, etc.
                    Again, the only prevention is to prevent the overuse of your eyes. They also need rest.
                    Sleep according to a regular schedule, idealy with an 8 hour slot of sleep.
                </p>
                <li>Back Pain</li>
                <p>
                    This might be odd coming in this very specific genre of a list, but it has to be said.
                    Severe back pains may occur if a person does not have an upright position while sitting.
                    One could be sitting in the same place, for hours on end with the same posture.
                    This may result in the person's posture being stunted. This will cause backpain.
                    A prevention to this is to obviously be upright while sitting.
                    However, another prevention could be to stand up every hour or so.
                    This will not only prevent the proble, but will also stretch your legs.
                </p>
                <li>Others</li>
                <p>
                    Of course, I am not including several different injuries one could have while in Quarantine.
                    I am just listing what may be the most common. Remember to be safe and healthy in these trying
                    times.
